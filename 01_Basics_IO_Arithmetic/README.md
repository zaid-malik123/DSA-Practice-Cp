# 📘 01_Basics_IO_Arithmetic

This folder contains beginner-friendly practice problems using **C++** that focus on:

- 📥 Taking input from the user
- 📤 Displaying output
- ➕ Basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction
- 🧠 Developing logic for input-output-based questions

## 🧾 What's Inside?

| File | Concept Covered | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `01_ask_name.cpp` | `cin`, `cout`, `string` | Asks user for their name and greets them |
| `02_addition.cpp` | `int`, `cin`, arithmetic`+` | Takes two numbers as input and outputs the sum |
| `03_tell_anything.cpp` | `string` input/output | Takes a message from the user and repeats it back |
| `04_input_number.cpp` | `int`, input/output | Asks the user to enter a number and prints it |
| `05_float_input.cpp` | `float`, input/output | Accepts a decimal number and displays it |
| `06_difference.cpp` | `int`, subtraction | Takes two numbers and shows their difference |

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen command over `cin` and `cout`
- Build muscle memory for basic syntax
- Make console-based interaction feel natural
- Prepare for more complex problems by mastering fundamentals

---

## 💡 Tip

> Practice these problems multiple times using different inputs. Understanding how input/output behaves is key to mastering any programming language.

## 🔄 To Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

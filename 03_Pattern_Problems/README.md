# 📘 03_Pattern_Problems

This folder contains beginner-friendly **pattern printing** problems using **C++** to build:

- 🧱 Understanding of loops (`for`, `while`)
- 🧠 Logical thinking with nested loops
- 🎨 Output formatting and alignment skills
- 🔁 Strong grip over flow control using loop constructs

## 🧾 What's Inside?

| File | Pattern Type | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `01_square_star.cpp` | ⭐ Square Pattern | Prints a square of stars |
| `02_right_triangle.cpp` | 🔺 Right-Angled Triangle | Stars in increasing order per line |
| `03_inverted_triangle.cpp` | 🔻 Inverted Triangle | Starts with full stars, decreases per row |
| `04_half_pyramid_numbers.cpp` | 🔢 Number Pyramid | Numbers printed in half-pyramid style |
| `05_butterfly_pattern.cpp` | 🦋 Butterfly | Stars forming butterfly shape using nested loops |
| `06_hollow_rectangle.cpp` | 📐 Hollow Rectangle | Borders printed, inside kept blank |

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Master nested loops for structured outputs
- Understand row-column logic for pattern generation
- Strengthen loop control and iteration logic
- Visualize code execution using printed patterns

---

## 💡 Tip

> Start by drawing the pattern on paper. Understand row vs column logic first, then convert it into code.

## 🔄 To Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

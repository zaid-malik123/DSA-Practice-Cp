# ðŸ“˜ 02_If_Else_Conditionals

This folder contains beginner-level practice problems using **C++** that focus on:

- ðŸ§  Decision making using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- ðŸ§® Applying conditions to control program flow
- ðŸ“Š Logical and comparison operators
- ðŸ§ª Building logic with real-life scenarios

---

## ðŸ§¾ What's Inside?

| File | Concept Covered | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `01_check_even_odd.cpp` | `if`, `%` operator | Checks whether a number is even or odd |
| `02_check_voting_age.cpp` | `if-else` | Checks if a person is eligible to vote |
| `03_max_of_two.cpp` | `if-else`, comparison | Finds the greater of two numbers |
| `04_pos_neg_zero.cpp` | `if-else` ladder | Checks if number is positive, negative, or zero |
| `05_grade_checker.cpp` | `if-else` conditions | Assigns grade based on marks entered |
| `06_nested_if_example.cpp` | Nested `if` | Demonstrates use of nested conditions |

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Learn how decision-making works in C++
- Understand how programs behave under different conditions
- Build real-world logical thinking using code
- Strengthen grasp of comparison and logical operators

## ðŸ’¡ Tip

> Donâ€™t just run the code â€” change the values, break it, and fix it. Thatâ€™s how you learn conditionals deeply.

---

## ðŸ”„ To Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

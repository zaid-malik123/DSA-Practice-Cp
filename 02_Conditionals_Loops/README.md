ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Understand decision-making in C++

Apply conditions to control program flow

Use comparison & logical operators effectively

Strengthen problem-solving with real-world scenarios

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

Donâ€™t just run the code â€” experiment with values, break it, and fix it.
Thatâ€™s the fastest way to master conditionals.

ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed. Then run:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

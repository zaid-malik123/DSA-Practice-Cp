# 📘 05_Number_System

This folder contains problems based on **number system conversions** using **C++**, including:

- 🔢 Decimal to Binary / Octal / Hexadecimal
- 🔁 Binary to Decimal
- 📐 Understanding how numbers work in different bases

---

## 🧾 What's Inside?

| File | Concept Covered | Description |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `01_decimal_to_binary.cpp` | Division method | Converts a decimal number to binary |
| `02_binary_to_decimal.cpp` | Place value method | Converts binary input into decimal 

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen understanding of number systems
- Prepare for input/output based conversion questions
- Build logic using loops and conditionals
- Sharpen thinking in terms of base systems (2, 8, 10, 16)

---

## 💡 Tip

> Always dry run your conversion logic with small numbers (like 5, 10, 15) to understand step-by-step working.

---

## 🔄 To Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then run:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

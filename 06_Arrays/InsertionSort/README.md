# Insertion Sort in C++

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm in C++.  
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting technique that builds the final sorted array one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements into their correct position.

## ðŸ“œ How Insertion Sort Works
1. Start from the second element (index `1`), treat the first element as sorted.
2. Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted part of the array.
3. Shift the elements one position ahead to make space for the current element if needed.
4. Repeat until the whole array is sorted.

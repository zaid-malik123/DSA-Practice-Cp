ðŸ“˜ 03_Arrays_Practice

This folder contains beginner-to-intermediate level C++ practice problems on arrays.
These exercises will help strengthen your understanding of array traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
File / Problem	Concept Covered	Description
Largest & Minimum in Array	for loop, INT_MIN, INT_MAX	Find the maximum and minimum element in an array
Search in Array	Linear search	Search for a value; return its index if found, else -1
Reverse an Array	Two-pointer approach, swap()	Reverse the array elements in place
Second Largest	Comparisons, loops	Find the largest and second largest elements
Second Minimum	Comparisons, loops	Find the smallest and second smallest elements
Missing Number (incomplete)	Logic building	Find the missing number in a sequence
Unique Numbers in Array	Nested loops, frequency count	Print numbers that occur only once
Left Rotation by 1	Shifting elements	Perform a single left rotation on the array
Search (Target in Sorted)	Linear search	Search for a given number in a sorted array
Sorting an Array	Nested loops, swapping	Sort an array in ascending order (basic selection/bubble sort)
ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Practice basic array operations

Implement linear search

Work with reversal and rotation of arrays

Build logic for unique & missing elements

Strengthen problem-solving with sorting algorithms

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

Try solving problems with different approaches (loops, STL functions, algorithms).

Test edge cases (e.g., all elements same, negative numbers, large values).

Optimize where possible (e.g., find min & max in a single pass).

ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++). Then run:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

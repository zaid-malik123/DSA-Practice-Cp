ðŸ“˜ 03_Arrays_Practice

This folder contains beginner-to-intermediate level C++ practice problems on arrays.
These exercises will strengthen your understanding of array traversal, searching, sorting, and manipulation.

ðŸ“‚ Contents
File / Problem	Concept Covered	Description
Largest & Minimum in Array	for loop, INT_MIN, INT_MAX	Find the maximum and minimum element in an array
Search in Array	Linear search	Find a given value in the array; return its index if found, else -1
Reverse an Array	Two-pointer approach, swap()	Reverse the elements of an array in place
Second Largest	for loop, comparisons	Find the largest and second largest elements
Second Minimum	for loop, comparisons	Find the smallest and second smallest elements
Missing Number (incomplete)	Logic building	(To be implemented) Find the missing number in a sequence
Unique Numbers in Array	Nested loops, frequency count	Print numbers that occur only once in the array
Left Rotation by 1	Shifting elements	Perform a single left rotation on the array
Search (target in sorted array)	Linear search	Search for a given number and return its index
Sorting an Array	Nested loops, swapping	Sort an array in ascending order (basic bubble/selection sort)
ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Practice basic array operations

Understand searching (linear)

Implement array reversal and rotation

Build logic for finding unique / missing numbers

Strengthen problem-solving with sorting algorithms

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

Try solving the problems with different approaches (loops, STL functions, etc.)

Modify the array size and values to test edge cases (like all same elements, negatives, etc.)

Once comfortable, try optimizing (e.g., using only one pass for min & max).

ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like g++). Then run:

g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output

This program implements Linear Search in C++ using a for-each loop. Linear Search is a simple searching algorithm that checks each element of the array (or vector) one by one until the target element is found or the list ends.

ðŸ›  Algorithm Steps
Start from the first element of the array/vector.

Compare each element with the target.

If the element matches the target, return its index.

If no element matches, return -1.

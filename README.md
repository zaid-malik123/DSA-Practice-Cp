# 🚀 Day 1 – C++ Basics Practice

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today, I focused on getting comfortable with C++ fundamentals by writing a few basic programs.

This day was all about understanding how to:
- Take input from users using `cin`
- Display output with `cout`
- Work with basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `string`
- Perform simple operations like addition and subtraction

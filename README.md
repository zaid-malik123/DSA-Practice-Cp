# 🚀 Day 1 – C++ Basics Practice
Date: 30-jul-2025

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today, I focused on getting comfortable with C++ fundamentals by writing a few basic programs.

This day was all about understanding how to:
- Take input from users using `cin`
- Display output with `cout`
- Work with basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `string`
- Perform simple operations like addition and subtraction

---

## ✅ Programs Practiced:

1.  Take User Name as Input
2. ➕ Add Two Integers
3. 💬 Echo What User Types
4. 🔢 Echo User Number
5. 🌡️ Input a Float Number
6. ➖ Subtract Two Integers

# 🚀 Day 2 – Conditional Statements Practice  
📅 Date: 31-Jul-2025

Welcome to **Day 2** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today was all about mastering **if-else conditions** and understanding how decisions are made in code.

I explored how to:
- Check if a number is **positive or negative**
- Determine **voting eligibility** using age
- Check if a number is **even or odd**
- Build a **grading system** based on marks
- Detect whether an entered character is **uppercase or lowercase**
- Learn the basics of **ASCII values** for character comparison

## ✅ Programs Practiced:

1. 🔢 **Positive or Negative Number**
   - Took an integer as input and checked if it’s positive or negative.

2. 🗳️ **Voting Eligibility Checker**
   - Used age to determine if the user is eligible to vote (18 or older).

3. 🔁 **Even or Odd Number Checker**
   - Determined if a number is even or odd using the modulus operator.

4. 📝 **Marks Grading System**
   - Based on marks input, printed grades like O, A+, A, B+, etc.

5. 🔠 **Character Case Checker**
   - Checked if a character is uppercase or lowercase using ASCII ranges.

---

## 📚 Concepts Revised:
- `if`, `else if`, `else` statements
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Character and ASCII handling in C++
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`

---

## 🔡 ASCII Reference Table (Important for Char Conditions):

| Character Range | ASCII Code  |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `'A' - 'Z'`     | 65 – 90     |
| `'a' - 'z'`     | 97 – 122    |

Great progress today 💪  
Tomorrow I'll move forward with **loops** in C++!

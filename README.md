# ðŸ“˜ DSA-Practice-Cpp

This repository contains my practice code for **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **C++**.

I'm using this folder to track and maintain my DSA learning journey.  
Problems are mainly solved from platforms like **LeetCode**, and are organized by difficulty level.

- Conceptual notes (if any)

Example:
- `Day 1/` â€“ C++ basics: input/output, variables
- `Day 2/` â€“ Conditional statements, loops
- `Day 3/` â€“ Pattern questions
- ...

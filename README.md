# 🚀 Day 1 – C++ Basics Practice  
📅 Date: 30-Jul-2025

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today, I focused on getting comfortable with C++ fundamentals by writing a few basic programs.

This day was all about understanding how to:
- Take input from users using `cin`
- Display output with `cout`
- Work with basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `string`
- Perform simple operations like addition and subtraction

---

## ✅ Programs Practiced:

1. 🧑 Take User Name as Input  
2. ➕ Add Two Integers  
3. 💬 Echo What User Types  
4. 🔢 Echo User Number  
5. 🌡️ Input a Float Number  
6. ➖ Subtract Two Integers

# 🚀 Day 2 – Conditional Statements & Loops Practice  
📅 Date: 31-Jul-2025

Today I practiced both **conditional statements** and **loops** in C++.

## ✅ Conditional Statements
- 🔢 Positive or Negative Number  
- 🗳️ Voting Eligibility Checker  
- 🔁 Even or Odd Number Checker  
- 📝 Marks Grading System  
- 🔠 Character Case Checker  

## 📚 Concepts Revised:
- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Character and ASCII handling

## 🔡 ASCII Reference Table:

| Character Range | ASCII Code |
|-----------------|------------|
| `'A' - 'Z'`     | 65 – 90    |
| `'a' - 'z'`     | 97 – 122   |

## 🔁 Loops Practiced

- 🔁 Print 1 to 5 using `while` loop  
- 🔢 Print numbers from 1 to `n` using `while`  
- ➕ Sum of even numbers till `n`  
- ➕ Sum of 1 to `n`  
- ➕ Sum of odd numbers

- 👋 Test `do-while` loop with false condition

## 📚 Loop Concepts Revised:
- `while`, `for`, `do-while`
- Entry/exit conditions
- Prime logic
- Summation inside loop

# 🚀 Day 3 – Pattern Practice  
📅 Date: 2-Aug-2025

Explored **nested loops** and **pattern printing** using characters, numbers, and special symbols.

## ✅ Patterns Practiced:

1. 🔢 `1 2 3 4` repeated rows  
2. 🔠 `A B C D` repeated rows  
3. 🔢 Counting number grid (1 to 9)  
4. 🔠 Alphabet grid (`A` to `I`)  
5. ⭐ Right-angled triangle of `*`  
6. 🔢 Repeating number triangle (1, 2 2, 3 3 3...)  
7. 🔠 Repeating alphabet triangle (`A`, `B B`, ...)  
8. 🔢 Increasing triangle (`1`, `1 2`, `1 2 3`...)  
9. 🔢 Reversed triangle (`1`, `2 1`, `3 2 1`, ...)  
10. 🔠 Reversed alphabet triangle (`A`, `B A`, `C B A`, ...)  
11. 🔢 Number flow triangle (1 to 10)  
12. 🔠 Alphabet flow triangle (`A` to `J`)  
13. 🔢 Inverted triangle with spaces and repeated numbers  
14. ⭐ Pyramid (`*` center aligned)  
15. 🔢 Palindromic number pyramid  
16. 🦋 Butterfly pattern with stars and dashes

## 📚 Concepts Covered:
- Nested loops
- ASCII manipulation for characters
- Managing spacing for alignment
- Pattern building logic (symmetry, rows, columns)


# 🚀 Day 4 – Functions & Scope in C++  
📅 Date: 3-Aug-2025

Today I focused on learning how to **create, use, and understand functions** in C++. I explored **parameters, return types, stack behavior, modular programming**, and also practiced **number system conversions**.

---

## ✅ Concepts Covered:

- What is a function and why we use it  
- Difference between **parameters** and **arguments**  
- Returning values from functions  
- Using `void` when no return is needed  
- Stack memory: how function calls work (LIFO)  
- Reusability and cleaner code using functions  
- Understanding **binary and decimal conversions**  
- Using modulus and multiplication for **digit-wise processing**

---

## ✅ Programs Practiced:

1. 🔊 **Simple Function Call**  
   - Created and called a `sayHello()` function

2. ➕ **Sum of Two Numbers (with parameters)**  
   - Created `sum(int a, int b)` function

3. 🔽 **Minimum of Two Numbers**  
   - Used conditional logic inside a function to return the smaller number

4. 🔢 **Sum of First N Numbers**  
   - Wrote `sumN(int n)` function to calculate total from 1 to `n`

5. ❗ **Factorial of a Number**  
   - Implemented `factN(int n)` function using a `for` loop

6. 🔢 **Sum of Digits of a Number**  
   - Wrote `sumD(int n)` function using modulus (`%`) and division (`/`) logic

7. 🔁 **Decimal to Binary Conversion**  
   - Used `% 2`, `/ 2`, and positional multiplication to convert a number to binary

8. 🔁 **Binary to Decimal Conversion**  
   - Parsed binary digit by digit and calculated its decimal equivalent using powers of 2

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:

- Functions make code **modular, readable, and reusable**
- Each function call is stored in the **call stack (LIFO)**
- Local variables live inside their respective function’s stack frame
- Binary ↔ Decimal conversions help understand **bitwise operations**
- Building logic with `while`, `%`, `/`, `*` trains deep logical reasoning

## 🧠 Key Takeaways:

- Functions make code **modular, readable, and reusable**
- Each function gets its own memory in the **call stack**
- Local variables inside functions exist only during function execution
- `void` return type is used when we don't want to return anything
- We can pass **arguments dynamically** to generalize logic

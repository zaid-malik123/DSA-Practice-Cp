# 🚀 Day 1 – C++ Basics Practice  
📅 Date: 30-Jul-2025

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today, I focused on getting comfortable with C++ fundamentals by writing a few basic programs.

This day was all about understanding how to:
- Take input from users using `cin`
- Display output with `cout`
- Work with basic data types like `int`, `float`, and `string`
- Perform simple operations like addition and subtraction

---

## ✅ Programs Practiced:

1. 🧑 Take User Name as Input  
2. ➕ Add Two Integers  
3. 💬 Echo What User Types  
4. 🔢 Echo User Number  
5. 🌡️ Input a Float Number  
6. ➖ Subtract Two Integers

# 🚀 Day 2 – Conditional Statements & Loops Practice  
📅 Date: 31-Jul-2025

Welcome to **Day 2** of my **C++ DSA Practice Journey**!  
Today I practiced both **conditional statements** and **loops** in C++.

---

## ✅ Conditional Statements

I explored how to:
- Check if a number is **positive or negative**
- Determine **voting eligibility**
- Check if a number is **even or odd**
- Build a **grading system**
- Identify whether a character is **uppercase or lowercase**
- Understand **ASCII values** for character comparisons

### ✅ Programs Practiced:
1. 🔢 Positive or Negative Number  
2. 🗳️ Voting Eligibility Checker  
3. 🔁 Even or Odd Number Checker  
4. 📝 Marks Grading System  
5. 🔠 Character Case Checker  

---

## 📚 Concepts Revised:
- `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`
- Character and ASCII handling
- Input/Output using `cin`, `cout`

---

## 🔡 ASCII Reference Table:

| Character Range | ASCII Code |
|-----------------|------------|
| `'A' - 'Z'`     | 65 – 90    |
| `'a' - 'z'`     | 97 – 122   |

---

## 🔁 Loops Practiced

I also explored **while**, **for**, and **do-while** loops today.

### ✅ Programs Practiced:

1. 🔁 Print 1 to 5 using `while` loop  
2. 🔢 Print numbers from 1 to `n` using `while`  
3. ➕ Sum of even numbers till `n` using `while`  
4. ➕ Sum of 1 to `n` using `for` loop  
5. ➕ Sum of odd numbers till `n` using `for`  
6. 🔍 Prime number check using `for`  
7. 👋 Test `do-while` loop with false condition (runs once)

---

## 📚 Loop Concepts Revised:
- `while` loop: Entry-controlled loop
- `for` loop: Best for known iterations
- `do-while` loop: Runs **at least once**
- Prime number check logic
- Summation using conditions inside loops
